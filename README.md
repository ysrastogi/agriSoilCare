# Using TensorFlow Lite Model in Android

This guide explains how to load and use a TensorFlow Lite model in an Android application to predict pH values from RGB data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
- Android Studio installed.
- An Android device or emulator.
- TensorFlow Lite model file (`model.tflite`) placed in the `assets` folder of your Android project.

## Steps

1. **Add TensorFlow Lite Dependency**:
   Add the TensorFlow Lite dependency to your `build.gradle` file:


2. **Load the Model**:
   Use the following code to load your TensorFlow Lite model:

    `java
    Interpreter tflite;
    try {
    tflite = new Interpreter(loadModelFile(activity));
    } catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }`


3. **Run the Model**:
   Create input and output arrays, and run the model:

   `java
    float[] input = new float[]{69.0f, 144.0f, 95.0f};
    float[] output = new float[1];
    tflite.run(input, output);
    System.out.println("Predicted pH: " + output[0]);`



4. **Handle the Model Output**:
   The output array will contain the predicted pH value, which you can use as needed in your application.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the input RGB values are preprocessed (if necessary) similarly to how they were handled during model training.
- Adjust the TensorFlow Lite version in the dependency according to the version used in your project.
